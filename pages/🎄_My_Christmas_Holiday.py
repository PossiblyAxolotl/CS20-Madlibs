Me and my family hope this will be a {answers[5]} Christmas this year! Usually, everyone is tired after all of that excitement. \
Many times, there's {answers[6]} lying all over the floor because people were partying so hard! \
Plus, the kids got some candy, so they're a little energetic the next day. \
They threw {answers[7]} {answers[8]} all over the living room last year because they got so energetic they couldn't control themselves! \
Can you believe it???\n\nAfter the party, we all say, "Have a {answers[9]} Christmas next year, too!"'''
